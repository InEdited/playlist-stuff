# Playlist breakdown cuz I'm lifeless 

## Vancouver sleep clinic - Into the black
Japanese type of omnious music that feels like sitting down with a bunch of bards under a big sakura tree, Lyrics caught me off guard but fits so well with the music somehow.

Calming and spacey brain go woosh I like.

## Vancouver sleep clinic - I sunk in all the memories
More western-ish music but still has the same spacy kind of feel, Lyrics are a little bit better than into the black and more fitting into the style imo, I overplayed this one a little it's really inspiring.

The background pads and strings are perfectly in sync I love it, only downside is that it's really short.

## Yot Club - Japan 
Very Beach House-y/The XX early 2000s indie type of beat I love it, sounds like something I'd try to create in the studio.

## Dan Deacon - Feel the lightning
Love the heavier music, The bass synth tickles im in love with it, the vocodex is one of my favorites I love this.

Also love the album art
## Sidewalks and Skeletons - Goth
Spooky vibe, very simple but hard hitting instrumentals, sounds like a better version of something I would make as a 16 yo.

## Goth babe - Sometimes
I think this is how bedroom indie synth pop should be it's amazing.

## American wolf - Forget these days
this is *chef's kiss* very dreamy synthwave and the mix is amazing love it.
 
## Lorn - Until there is no end
Surprisingly heavy bass actually surprised you like that kind of stuff, personally love it there's a layer of subbass that tickles my ears and literally moves the headphones I love it.

## Fantasy guys - Another moon
I love this I love the synth solo, it feels very early 90s depressed guy locked in his room with a bunch of synthesizers and lots of time.
and the bass is one of the sexiest things ever it's *chef's kiss*.

## Lo-Fang - #88
Whatever that stringed instrument in the beginning sounds like me missing around with a violin holding it like a guitar I love it, the mix of instruments with it is really upnormal, in a good way the strings in the breakdown are so in sync and perfectly mixed.

His voice is really nice

## Beach House - Myth
I already know and love this one, not many words can describe beach house music.

## Nick Leng - Playing with fire
Really chill song, would play in car in a chill happy car ride it's the perfect mood for it.

## Apparet - Candil de La Calle
I had to listen to this one 4 times in a row to figure out the music going on with this, it's amazing I'll send it to Omar cuz it's exactly the type of electronic music we love.

## Apparet - The soft voices die
I'm not even sure how I can describe how interesting this type of music is to me, if the third song by Apparet sounds the same I'm listening to their whole discography after this playlist.

## Apparet - Song of Los 
That bouncing ping pong bass all over my head got me, it's over I'm listening to the whole album next.

## KLOUD - BLOOD
Listening behind the vocals of this one it sounds like ghostrunner OST so much I could mistake it for one, surprised how they could fit vocals with this type of beat.

## CASTLEBEAT - I Follow
Driving an old car in the fields road with a partner kind of song love it.
It feels and sounds just like it's album art? Like that's what I'd expect I'm listening to just looking at the art.

There's a weird rhythm in the background that kept the beat interesting even though it's mostly a simple song.

## Loma - Black willow
Her voice reminds me of something I know, I love this song and I love the twinkling pads in the background mix with the upfront bass guitar.

I find the pace of the music perfect on this one.

## Syd Matters - Obstacles
The intro of this song was misleading I thought it would be a little boring but it kept getting better and better I kept replaying it.

##  slenderbodies - hearth
This is such a study n chill lofi song I'm in love with it.

## Soren lorensen, aqualung, davide rossi - Swallow
That's a lot of artists on one song, I love it I just hate how the best part is so short and towards the end the last minute and half are the best part about it but it ends too soon, could easily be a 7+ minutes song.

## Kevin Morby - Harlem River
This sounds like a typical chill radio song, it's too long for how little it changes though.

## Kevin Morby - Parade
I love LOVE the guitar and bass tone on this and the mix of the instruments is amazing love this one.

## Liza Anne - Dreams
I love the intro and midway of this song I realized I listened to it sometime before and loved it, the strings and vocal pads in the bridge are just *chef's kiss*.

## AURORA - Half the world away 
Already in my likes, did I mention how much I love her voice? 

## alt-j - Pleader
Another one straight from my likes, I love alt-j.

## Chelou - Halfway to Nowhere
I love the album art so much, the intro is pretty catchy.

Lyrics hit hard like a truck tho this isn't something I'd expect with this kind of music. 

## Cemeteries - Sodus
I need to figure out how to copy the intro pads to this song somehow I love it.
The bridge is amazing and very emotional, the mix sounds intentional that the vocals are way in the back kinda like cigarettes after sex.

The twinkles in the middle bridge are so great and hurtful, I can't describe it better it just is, makes me wanna cry, the whole bridge does.

After coming back to this I realized 2 of my friends made me listen to this album before but I used to zone out listening to it, exactly what I'd normally do listening to this kind of music cuz ig focusing just hurts with this one.

## Ghostly Kisses - Clay
I have this song in my likes too, I love her voice so much it's one of the very few female voices that makes me feel things.

This song specifically me and my sister overplay it in the car, it sounds so much better on car speakers.

## Kalaido - Whisked Away Again
Very lofi and chill type of song I love it, it's also very inspiring.

The bpm of this song is perfect for my brain to focus and work with it actually it's just right.

## Nine Inch Nails - The persistance of loss, 12 Ghosts ||, 13 Ghosts ||
I didn't know you would like NIN I know all their discography almost by heart I love their music so much you have no idea.

## Son Lux - Race to erase
I listened to this like 4 times in a row I forget to hear the lyrics every single time I just get lost in the music and atmosphere, I promise I'll figure out what they're saying one day but the music is too good.
